I created this tool because I found it infuriating to download stuff from The Sims Resource, their 15 second wait along with only being able to download a single item at a time and them plastering advertisements everywhere for their VIP service.

With this tool you can download multiple items at once, to download items copy the url of the item, the tool monitors your clipboard for valid URLs to download from, and will automatically start downloading the item to the supplied directory in the `config.json` file.
